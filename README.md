# PowerLift-Tracker
Dynamically log and track any weight lifting exercise with this customizable app

## Synopsis

PowerLift Tracker is an android app created by Fahad Hassan. It allows users to store their workout sessions, save templates,
set timer lengths, choose perfereed unit type (LB or Kg), and much more.

Supports 1x1 - 8x20 weightlifting workouts


## Motivation
I created this app as I noticed their wasn't a solid power lifting app on the google play store that allowed for customizing workouts and saving templates(which was a huge motivator for me). This also got me more exposed to the android studio sdk.
